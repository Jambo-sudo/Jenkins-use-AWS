# Jenkins on AWS EC2
We take the [Historical-document-layout-analysis](https://github.com/Jambo-sudo/Historical-document-layout-analysis) as an example to show how to deploy project to AWS EC2 instance through jenkins. You can fork this porject to your GitHub and follow this tutorial. We will create two EC2 instances, one is jenkins manager and another is jenkins slave. Our project will running in jenkins slave. The project is triggered by GitHub webhook. When the GitHub is pushed any commit, jenkins will automatically build the project.

## Requirement
In order to complete the deployment, you need an AWS account and some basic knowledge about AWS. The minimum requirements for these two instances are as follows:
1. Jenkins manager can use any free instance. We use t2.micro instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) (the default choice when you create EC2).

2. Jenkins slave need at least 4GB of RAM and 12GB of storage (you need more storage to save the reuslt, if you wanna real use it). In this project, we use t2.medium and bind a 16GB volume, with Ubuntu 20.04. We do not recommend using Amazon Linux or CentOS because there may be problems with docker adaptation.

## Security groups
For jenkins manager and jenkins slave, we configure two security groups respectively.
1. For Jenkins manager, we should add a Custom TCP rule in inbound rules, select port 8080, in the source part, enter the IP address of the host (the local computer you are using to connect AWS). If you don't know the IP address, enter "what is my IP address" in any browser. This rule will open port 8080 for your and <b> only </b> for your host. Port 8080 is the default configuration page of Jenkins.   

In addition, you also need to add 3 similar rules to open 8080 for GitHub's webhook. In these 3 rules, change the source to the [IP address of GitHub hook](https://api.github.com/meta). 

<b>Note</b>: You can also set source to 0.0.0.0/0 here. But we do not recommend this because it will make your jenkins manager open to everyone. 

2. For Jenkins slave we only need to add a single rule which is open port 5000. This is because our project needs to use this port. If you deploy another project, then this rule will be determined according to your project. Set source to 0.0.0.0/0, than anyone can visit this project webpage.

In addition, the security group has a default rule, which is to open port 22. This is the port we connect to AWS instances, so don't delete this rule.

## Configure Jenkins manager
In AWS EC2 console, select jenkins manager instance. In the upper right corner click "connect" you will find several ways to connect instance from your local machine. After connecting to this instance, we need to install jenkins on this instance. jenkins is based on Java, so we should install Java first.   

`	sudo yum install java -y`  

Now download jenkins repo:  

`sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo`   

`sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key`  

You can choose the corresponding [Jenkins version](https://pkg.jenkins.io/) according to your OS. We use the redhat-stable jenkins repo for our system, if you using the Amazon Linux you can use this jenkins version as well.
Install jenkins and start the service:  

`sudo yum install jenkins`  

`sudo service jenkins start`  

The jenkins should start now, use `systemctl status jenkins` to check the status of jenkins. If jenkins is running, open the browser and enter: <Public IPv4 address for jenkins manager instance>:8080 to enter the jenkins configuration page. The you can find the Public IPv4 address in AWS EC2 console. Now you enter the jenkins configuration webpage, you need to enter the password to unlock it. Use `sudo cat ...` command to get the password. Here we install the default plugin which will contain the git, and that fine enough for this project. 

## Configure jenkins slave
We use Ubuntu 20.04 instead of the same operating system as jenkins manager (Amazon Linux). Because Amazon Linux has encountered some problems in docker, if you use different project, then you should choose OS system based on that.  
This instance is used to deploy our project, so there is no need to install jenkins. But in order to manage though jenkins manager, we need to install Java.   

`sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk`  
The Java version should be the same as the jenkins manager.   

After that, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).      
Now, we done everything in this instance.

## Add jenkins slave in jenkins manager
Open the webpage of jenkins manager, select Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes and clouds -> New Node. Enter the node name and select Permanent Agent. You will find the configuration page like followï¼š  

<img src="image/jenkins-node.png" text-align:center alt="web start page" width="1000"> 

Here is an explanation of some parameters:  
Remote root directory is the root directory of jenkins slave instance. You can find it in the EC2 console or use CMD `pwd` in jenkins slave. Different OS will have different root directories, so your directory maybe not this one.
Label is when you create a jenkins project, you can select the node to deploy project through label.   
In the launch method, select Launch agents via SSH, and then enter the Public IPV4 address of the slave instance in the Host. In the Credentials part, select private key, and then enter the key which used to connect to the EC2 instance. This key is a pem file saved in your local machine.  

Click save and you will find this new node on the jenkins node page after a while. If adding fail, right-click the node, and then check the log to find the reason.

## Connect to GitHub via webhook
When some commit is pushed to GitHub, jenkins will automatically build a new project. To achieve this, we need to use webhook. 
1. In Manage Jenkins -> Configure Jenkins -> GitHub -> Advanced -> Override Hook URL. Copy this URL, if you cannot find GitHub, than you should install Github in plugin.
2. In your GitHub -> Setting -> Webhooks -> add webhook -> playload URL. Paste the URL.  

Note: Don't forget add the GitHub's IP in your jenkins manager security group, otherwise jenkins may not receive the webhook.  

## Run project in slave node
In jenkins, New Item -> (give a name) Freestyle. Then you will find the configuration page, configure as follows:  
1. Restrict where this project can be run, use the label of your jenkins slave node.
2. Source Code Management -> Git. Give the Repository URL and credentials, you can [copy our project](https://github.com/Jambo-sudo/Historical-document-layout-analysis) or use your own project. 
3. Branches to build. Use 'main' or just leave it empty because we only have one branch. (there may multiple branches in your project.)
4. Build Triggers -> GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.
5. Build -> Execute shells. Use the follow shell script:  

`chmod +x ./build.sh`  

`sudo ./build.sh`

You can find the details of build.sh in [here](https://github.com/Jambo-sudo/Historical-document-layout-analysis/blob/main/build.sh).  

Now everything is ready! You can commit any change to this GitHub repo, or click build now in jenkins project page. Jenkins will automatically build this project and deploy it to the slave node. Then enter <Public IPv4 address for jenkins slave instance>:5000 in any browser, you will find the start page of this project. If your security groups followed our recommendations, then this website is open to the public right now. You can invite your family and friends to visit this website.   
Don't invite too many people! This is not a product project. Jenkins slave only has 4G memory, which is not enough to handle large input. We do not have any backup and load balancing to deal with large-scale access as well.

Don't forget to <b> terminate </b> your EC2 instance. Unless you want to burn your credit.

## Some common errors
1. The webhook cannot be triggered.  
The most likely reason is that the GitHub's IP was not added in the security group of jenkins manager, which caused jenkins can't receive the webhook. You can check whether the webhook is triggered in the GitHub setting.  

In addition, if your jenkins cannot access the public network (deployed on a local virtual machine). You can change the Build Triggers. Use poll SCM instead of webhook, enter * * * * * (five stars) in the scheduler, which means check the GitHub repo every minute. 

2. ERROR: Error cloning remote repo 'origin'  
This error may occur when jenkins building the project. There are several reasons for this error, it maybe because jenkins can't find git, so it can't clone anything. You can go to Global Tool Configuration -> git -> Install automatically (check it). If you have selected and still get this error, then you may need to manually enter the path to Git. You can pass `whereis git` in CMD to find the path to git.  
Another possible but almost unmentioned reason is: the credentials were not added when adding GitHub repo URL. Even your GitHub repo is public, you still need to set credentials.
